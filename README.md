# BA780_final_project
This is the final project of my course BA780. 
In this project, my team explored the 2014 dataset of Citi Bike. We gained the rental bike data from their website and came up with analytical results. We have made user behavioral analyses using user-specific data, geographical data for location-specific analysis, and trip duration analysis. With all this information, we also provided a couple of recommendations to the Citi Bikes team.
